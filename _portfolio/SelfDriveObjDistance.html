        <p>This project demonstrates a robust vision system for self-driving cars. It focuses on three core tasks: <strong>plane estimation</strong>, <strong>lane detection</strong>, and <strong>object distance estimation</strong> using semantic segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: Plane Estimation -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Plane Estimation</h2>
            <p>Using RANSAC, the ground plane is accurately estimated from depth data, which is essential for understanding the road surface and ensuring stable vehicle navigation.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Technologies:</strong> RANSAC, Depth Estimation, 3D Plane Fitting.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Lane Boundary Detection -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Lane Boundary Detection</h2>
            <p>Implemented lane boundary detection using semantic segmentation, edge detection (Canny), and line estimation (Hough Transform). Redundant lines were merged and horizontal lines filtered out to ensure reliable lane detection.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Technologies:</strong> OpenCV, Semantic Segmentation, Canny Edge Detection, Hough Transform.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Object Distance Estimation -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Object Distance Estimation</h2>
            <p>Combined 2D object detection with depth estimation to compute the minimum distance to objects. This ensures accurate proximity measurement for collision avoidance, a critical feature in autonomous driving.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Technologies:</strong> Object Detection, Depth Estimation, Euclidean Distance Calculation.</p>

            <h2>Trajectory Estimation from Visual Data</h2>
            <p>Developed a pipeline for estimating camera trajectories using 2D image sequences, feature matching, and pose estimation. The system tracks the motion of a camera in 3D space, reconstructing its trajectory over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Technologies:</strong> ORB Feature Extraction, PnP (Perspective-n-Point), Essential Matrix Decomposition, RANSAC.</p>
